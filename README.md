# Gyro Portal – Vanilla JavaScript Edition

A lightweight web-based version of the Spline gyroscope playground.  
This project brings real-time device motion controls to a Spline 3D scene directly in the browser using **vanilla JavaScript** and the **Spline Web Runtime**.

Originally inspired by Gábor Pribék’s SwiftUI version, this adaptation focuses on making it easy to run gyroscope-controlled Spline scenes on **any mobile browser** (iOS or Android), without needing an app.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Tilt‑based interaction using **DeviceMotion**  
- Real‑time rotation of objects inside a Spline scene  
- A “tap to enable motion” flow that works across iOS and Android  
- Simple vanilla JS setup suitable for mobile websites  
- Optional HTTPS tunneling support for iOS motion permission  

Hold your phone naturally (~30–45°), tilt it around, and watch the Spline object react smoothly.

## Features

- 📱 Mobile‑friendly gyro control  
- 🎮 Smooth rotation mapping  
- 🌐 Pure vanilla JavaScript  
- 🎨 Spline Web Runtime integration  
- 🔒 iOS‑compatible permission handling  
- 🍃 No frameworks, minimal setup  
- 🚀 Works locally or over HTTPS with a Cloudflare tunnel  

## Running Locally

1. Start a local server in your project folder:

```
npx serve
```

2. Your server will start (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).

3. To open it on your phone:
   - Ensure both devices are on the same Wi‑Fi
   - Open the LAN URL shown in your terminal (`http://192.168.x.x:3000`)

This works immediately on **Android**, but iOS may require HTTPS for motion permissions.

## Using HTTPS (Cloudflare Tunnel)

iOS requires a secure origin (HTTPS) to prompt for motion access.  
You can create a temporary HTTPS link using Cloudflare Tunnel.

1. In a separate terminal, install cloudflared:

```
brew install cloudflared
```

2. Run the following to get a HTTPS link:

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

3. Copy the generated HTTPS link (e.g., `https://abc123.trycloudflare.com`) and open it on your phone.

Each time you restart the tunnel, a new link is generated.

## Deployment

All files are static — you can host them anywhere:

- Vercel  
- Netlify  
- GitHub Pages  
- Your own server  

If deploying in a subdirectory, update your `wasmURL` in `index.html` accordingly.

This project was inspired by **Gábor Pribék’s SwiftUI Spline Gyro Playground**, which demonstrated the same concept using the native iOS Spline Runtime.
